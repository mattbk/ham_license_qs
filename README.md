# Ham License Questions

This is a toy I built to help myself (and maybe others) be exposed to amateur radio ("ham 
radio") license exam questions, which are public in the US.

It currently toots to Mastodon at [@hackgfk_311@botsin.space](https://botsin.space/@hackgfk_311).

Written in R because I'm much quicker at that than Python, and it seemed like a fun use case.

Pull requests always welcome!

If you want to run this yourself (for dev or fun), you can download the question pools from
https://github.com/russolsen/ham_radio_question_pool and place in `/lib`.
